# Seganku

Seganku is an animal survival hiding and foraging game inspired by 'shelter'.
This was implemented as an introduction to OpenGL as part of the undergraduate Computer Graphics Lab Assignment in 2015.

The protagonist is a small skunk in need to get ready for hibernation. For that purpose they shall eat a certain amount of food to get nice and fat, and then find back to the den, before the sun sets, so they will be safe. Antagonists are eagles, from which it is advised to hide in bushes. All that running around and searching for food also uses some energy, and will require a proper ingestion of wild edibles. 
The eagle circling in the sky will at times try to chase and eat the protagonist unless they manage to find cover or use their special defense technique. It's vital to keep an eye on the sky!
