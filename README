OPENGL GAME
TITLE: SEGANKU

DESCRIPTION
Seganku is an animal survival hiding and foraging game inspired by shelter. The player finds himself in the role of a small skunk, foraging for food like berries, roots etc to get ready for hibernation. Life would be fairly easy if those eagles weren't foraging as well — for you. When the skies cry and dark shadows of peril loom over those hills: Don't waste no time, Duck and cover!
